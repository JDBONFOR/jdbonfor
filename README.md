I am proficient in Swift 3+ for both UIKit and SwiftUI development, and have a solid understanding of design patterns like MVC and MVVM. Additionally, I have experience with reactive programming using RxSwift, RxCocoa, and Combine. For network connections, I have used URLSession and Alamofire. I also have expertise with Firebase platforms for push notifications, remote configuration, and App Distribution. To integrate third-party libraries, I utilize tools such as SPM and Cocoapods.
